=head1 NAME

App::Rad::Plugin::ReadLine::Demo - export &demo into your App::Rad app, so you can use ExampleRunner in the pod

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 what?!

this is a little bit of trickery that adds an action to your App::Rad app 
that lets me run App::Rad::RreadLine commands by listing their names 
as arguments to the application.

=head1 EXPORTS

I love export based interfaces. 

both are available on request ...

=head2 C<&demo>

which then calls the actions listed
replaces C<Term::UI>'s C<get_reply> method so that C<App::Rad::Plugin::ReadLine> thinks that users are typing those commands ...

and then calls the first action listed in @ARGV to get the ball rolling.

=head2 C<&getopt>

an action that dumps C<< $c->options, $c->argv, @ARGV >>, to convince you
(and me) that App::Rad is being passed arguments that make sense based on what
is typed in by the user...

This would be beter done in the test suite...
